# Week 3: Robotic Kinematics and Motion Planning

## Overview
This week we will study the mathematical foundations of robotic movement, including forward and inverse kinematics, and motion planning algorithms.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand forward and inverse kinematics
- Learn about different motion planning algorithms
- Implement basic kinematic calculations
- Develop simple motion planning solutions

## Materials Needed
- Mathematical software (MATLAB, Python with NumPy, etc.)
- Simulation environment for kinematic analysis
- Robotic arm model or simulator (optional)

## Topics Covered
1. Forward Kinematics
2. Inverse Kinematics
3. Jacobian Matrices
4. Motion Planning Algorithms
5. Trajectory Generation
