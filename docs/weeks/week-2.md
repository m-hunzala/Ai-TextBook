# Week 2: Robotic Sensors and Actuators

## Overview
This week we will explore different types of sensors and actuators used in robotics, their characteristics, and how they integrate with robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand different types of sensors used in robotics
- Learn about various actuators and their control
- Explore sensor-actuator integration
- Implement basic sensor reading and actuator control

## Materials Needed
- Sensor modules (distance, touch, camera, etc.)
- Actuator components (motors, servos, etc.)
- Microcontroller board
- Connecting cables and breadboard

## Topics Covered
1. Types of Robotic Sensors
2. Sensor Characteristics and Specifications
3. Different Types of Actuators
4. Sensor-Actuator Integration
5. Basic Control Systems
