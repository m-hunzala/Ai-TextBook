# Week 6: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)

## Overview
This week we will study SLAM algorithms, which allow robots to build maps of unknown environments while simultaneously localizing themselves within those maps.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand SLAM problem formulation
- Learn different SLAM algorithms
- Implement basic SLAM solutions
- Analyze SLAM performance and limitations

## Materials Needed
- SLAM simulation environment
- Sensor simulation (LIDAR, camera, IMU data)
- Mathematical software for SLAM algorithms
- Sample datasets for testing

## Topics Covered
1. SLAM Problem Formulation
2. Filter-based SLAM (EKF, Particle Filter)
3. Graph-based SLAM
4. Visual SLAM (vSLAM)
5. Loop Closure and Map Optimization
