# Week 7: Robotic Path Planning and Navigation

## Overview
This week we will explore algorithms and techniques for planning paths and navigating robots in various environments.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand different path planning algorithms
- Learn about navigation stacks and frameworks
- Implement path planning solutions
- Integrate path planning with control systems

## Materials Needed
- Navigation simulation environment
- Path planning software libraries
- Environment mapping tools
- Robot simulator for testing

## Topics Covered
1. Path Planning Algorithms (A*, Dijkstra, RRT)
2. Global vs Local Planning
3. Navigation Stacks (ROS Navigation)
4. Obstacle Avoidance
5. Multi-robot Navigation
