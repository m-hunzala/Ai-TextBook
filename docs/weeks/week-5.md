# Week 5: Robotic Perception and Computer Vision

## Overview
This week we will explore how robots perceive their environment using cameras, LIDAR, and other sensing modalities, focusing on computer vision techniques.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand different perception modalities in robotics
- Learn computer vision fundamentals for robotics
- Implement basic image processing algorithms
- Integrate vision with robotic control

## Materials Needed
