# Week 10: Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)

## Overview
This week we will study how humans and robots can interact effectively, including interfaces, communication methods, and safety considerations.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand principles of human-robot interaction
- Learn about different interaction modalities
- Explore safety considerations in HRI
- Implement basic HRI interfaces

## Materials Needed
- Robot platform with interactive capabilities
- Interface development tools
- Safety equipment for HRI experiments
- User study materials

## Topics Covered
1. Principles of Human-Robot Interaction
2. Interaction Modalities (speech, gesture, touch)
3. Social Robotics
4. Safety in Human-Robot Interaction
5. Evaluation Methods for HRI
