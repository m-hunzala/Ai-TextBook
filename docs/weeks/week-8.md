# Week 8: Robotic Manipulation and Grasping

## Overview
This week we will study robotic manipulation principles, including kinematics of manipulators, grasping strategies, and manipulation planning.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand manipulator kinematics
- Learn about grasping strategies
- Implement basic manipulation algorithms
- Analyze grasp stability and planning

## Materials Needed
- Robotic manipulator (physical or simulated)
- Grasping simulation environment
- Object models for manipulation
- End-effector tools and grippers

## Topics Covered
1. Manipulator Kinematics
2. Grasping Principles and Strategies
3. Force and Torque Control
4. Manipulation Planning
5. Grasp Planning and Optimization
