## Vendor Recommendations

### Major Electronics Retailers
- **Adafruit**: High-quality components, excellent tutorials and support
- **SparkFun**: Educational focus, good selection of robotics components
- **Pololu**: Specializes in robotics components, high quality
- **Amazon**: Convenient shipping, wide variety but variable quality

### Specialized Robotics Vendors
- **Trossen Robotics**: Robot kits and manipulator arms
- **Robotis**: Premium robotic servo systems
- **Parallax**: Educational robotics components
- **Lynxmotion**: Robot chassis and accessories

## Budgeting Tips

1. **Buy in Bulk**: Purchase common components like resistors, capacitors, and jumper wires in bulk to save money.

2. **Student Discounts**: Many vendors offer student discounts - be sure to check before purchasing.

3. **Open Source Hardware**: Consider open-source hardware options which are often more affordable.

4. **Simulation First**: Use simulation environments before buying expensive physical hardware.

5. **Group Purchases**: Coordinate with classmates to buy components in bulk for group projects.

## Alternative Low-Cost Options

For budget-conscious students, consider building simple robots with:
- Cardboard or 3D-printed chassis
- Low-cost electronics from compatible vendors
- Repurposed components from old electronics
- Simulator-based learning initially before hardware purchase

## Maintenance and Replacement

Budget an additional 10-15% for replacement components due to damage during learning process. Have backup supplies for commonly damaged items like servo horns and mounting brackets.
