# Capstone Project: Autonomous Robotic System

## Overview
The capstone project is a comprehensive application of all concepts learned throughout the course. Students will design, implement, and demonstrate an autonomous robotic system that solves a real-world problem.

## Project Objectives
- Integrate multiple robotics concepts learned in the course
- Design a complete robotic solution to a specified problem
- Demonstrate proficiency in hardware-software integration
- Present and document the robotic system professionally

## Project Specifications

### Project Requirements
1. **Autonomy**: The robot must operate autonomously for at least 5 minutes without human intervention
2. **Functionality**: Must solve a meaningful problem using robotics technologies
3. **Integration**: Must integrate sensing, planning, and control components
4. **Documentation**: Complete technical documentation and user manual
5. **Presentation**: Professional oral presentation and demonstration

### Technical Requirements
- Sensor integration (minimum 2 different sensor types)
- Path planning or navigation capability
- Control system implementation
