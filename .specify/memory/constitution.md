# My New Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clarity and Readability
Code must be clear, concise, and easily understandable by other developers. Prioritize readability over cleverness.

### II. Modularity and Reusability
Design components with clear responsibilities and minimal dependencies. Promote reusability across the project.

### III. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
All new features and bug fixes must be accompanied by comprehensive tests. Tests should be written before implementation and used to drive development.

### IV. Incremental Development
Favor small, iterative changes and frequent integration. Avoid large, monolithic changes.

### V. Security by Design
Security considerations must be integrated into every stage of the development lifecycle. Follow secure coding practices and conduct regular security reviews.

### VI. Performance Awareness
Consider performance implications during design and implementation. Optimize critical paths and measure performance regularly.

## Coding Standards

Adhere to established coding style guides (e.g., ESLint, Prettier for JavaScript). Use meaningful variable and function names.

## Review Process

All code changes must undergo peer review before merging. Reviewers are responsible for ensuring adherence to principles and standards.

## Governance

This constitution serves as the guiding document for all development within the project. Amendments require a consensus among team leads and documentation of the rationale. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
